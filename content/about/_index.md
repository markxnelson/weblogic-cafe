# About WebLogic Café

Welcome to the WebLogic Café.  This is the blog of Mark Nelson, an architect 
at Oracle, in the WebLogic team.  I work with technologies like Docker, 
Kubernetes, Istio, OpenShift, ELK, Prometheus, Grafana, as well as developer
focused technology areas like CI/CD.  So that's the kind of thing I will 
be writing about here!
