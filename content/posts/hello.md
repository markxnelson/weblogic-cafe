Hello and welcome to my new blog!  

I am an architect at Oracle, and I work in the WebLogic team.  I work with 
technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Istio, OpenShift, ELK, Prometheus,
Grafana, as well as developer focused technology areas like CI/CD.  So that's 
the kind of thing I will be writing about here! 

I hope you come back soon to read my first real post! 

p.s. I am just getting started setting up the blog, I am using 
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for this blog, unlike 
[my old blog](http://redstack.wordpress.com) which used WordPress, 
so I am learning how to drive Hugo!
