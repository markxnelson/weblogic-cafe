Hi everyone!  I have not written as many posts as I had hoped to lately, but
I have been busy getting ready for Oracle OpenWorld next week and we have some
exciting things to share with you all there. 

We have a [Program Guide](https://events.rainfocus.com/widget/oracle/oow19/1561733960079001U3LK)
for WebLogic, Coherence and Helidon available that lists a lot of great 
sessions you can attend, including some that I will be presenting at. 

The Enterprise Java Roadmap session on Monday 9-9.45 in Moscone South 209 
will have a lot of interesting new information and I highly recommend that
session. 

We also have some of our great customers presenting sessions to talk about
their experiences with WebLogic on Kubernetes, for example IntesaSanpaolo
on Monday 12.15-1 Moscone South 210, CERN Tuesday 1.45-2.30 Moscone South 
155B and Intris Tuesday 3.15-4 Moscone South 151B.

I can't tell you everything before the sessions, but I think if you can
attend you are sure to hear about things like:

* our continued investment in making WebLogic and Coherence run really 
  well in Kubernetes/CNCF environments, and to let you take advantage of 
  cloud native features and techniques, like distributed tracing for
  example,
* continued efforts to provide more options to make WebLogic have a 
  smaller footprint and better performance in Kubernetes, 
* additional certifications and supported platforms and container runtimes, 
* our Helidon project for microservices development, 
* great performance and memory usage improvements you can make with GraalVM 
  native image compilation of your microservices, and
* work we are doing to make traditional Java EE applications (like the ones you
  run on WebLogic Server) and modern microservices applications (like the
  ones you write with Helidon) easy to manage and monitor in hybrid cloud
  environments.

There are also hands on labs and a lot of other opportunites to learn 
about and try microservices development with Helidon, hear about Java EE 8
and Jakarta EE 8 (which was just released this week!) and lot of other 
exciting work around other parts of the CNCF ecosystem, things like Istio,
Kiali, Jaeger and also complementary technologies like Rancher and GitLab.

If you are at OpenWorld and want to say hello, you can ping me on our 
[public WebLogic slack](https://weblogic-slack-inviter.herokuapp.com/), 
or @markxnelson on twitter.
