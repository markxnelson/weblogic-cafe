In case you missed it, we released version 2.0.1 of the [WebLogic Kubernetes
Operator](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator) this week. 
This release mainly contains bug fixes, but we also
announced [certification for OpenShift](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/introduction/introduction/#openshift).

This means you can now run WebLogic Server on OpenShift using our operator
and you can call Oracle Support to log a Service Request, or of course, 
come talk to us on our [public slack channel](https://weblogic-slack-inviter.herokuapp.com/). 

What's next?  We are working on support for JRF-enable domains, i.e. ADF,
SOA, BPM, etc., and we are planning to include some of the groundwork for that
in our next release, tentatively called 2.1.
