      <title>Storing ATP Wallets in a Kubernetes Secret</title>

      <description>In this previous post, we talked about how to create a WebLogic datasource for an ATP database. In that example we put the ATP wallet into the domain directly, which is fine if your domain is on a secure environment, but if we want to use ATP from a WebLogic domain running in Kubernetes, you might not want to burn the wallet into the Docker image. Doing so would enable anyone with access to the Docker image to retrieve the wallet.</description>

      <title>Operator 2.0.1 Released with OpenShift Certification</title>

      <description>In case you missed it, we released version 2.0.1 of the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator this week. This release mainly contains bug fixes, but we also announced certification for OpenShift.
This means you can now run WebLogic Server on OpenShift using our operator and you can call Oracle Support to log a Service Request, or of course, come talk to us on our public slack channel.
What&amp;rsquo;s next? We are working on support for JRF-enable domains, i.</description>

      <title>Configuring a WebLogic Data Source to use ATP</title>

      <description>In this post I am going to share details about how to configure a WebLogic data source to use ATP.
If you are not familiar with ATP, it is the new Autonomous Transaction Processing service on Oracle Cloud. It provides a fully managed autonomous database. You can create a new database in the OCI console in the Database menu under &amp;ldquo;Autonomous Transaction Processing&amp;rdquo; by clicking on that big blue button:</description>

      <title>WebLogic on OpenShift</title>

      <description>Note: This post is also available on the official WebLogic Server blog.
In this post I am going to walk through setting up and using WebLogic on OpenShift, using the Oracle WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator. My starting point is the OpenShift Container Platform server that I set up on OCI in this earlier post.
I am going to use the operator to manage my domains in OpenShift. The operator pattern is common in Kubernetes for managing complex software products that have special lifecycle requirements, different to the base assumptions made by Kubernetes.</description>

      <title>WebLogic Kubernetes Operator 2.0 Release Candidate 2 now available</title>

      <description>We have just made our 2.0 Release Candidate 2 of the Oracle WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator available for early adopters.
The 2.0 release adds some significant new features including:
 Support for burning your WebLogic domain into the Docker image, in addition to supporting the domain being on persistent storage, The operator is now installed using Helm charts, replacing the earlier scripts, You can override domain configuration using configuration override templates, Load balancers and Ingress can now be independently configured, WebLogic logs can be directed to a persistent volume or the WebLogic server console output (stdout) can be directed to the pod log, Added lifecycle support for servers and significantly more configurability for generated pods.</description>

      <title>Relocate the /var/lib/docker storage on an OpenShift system</title>

      <description>Today I ran out of space in the filesystem containing the /var/lib/docker directory on my OpenShift system, which meant I could not schedule any new pods (you get an error about disk pressure). So I decided I needed some more space.
I created a new partition with parted and then I updated my /etc/fstab to include that partition, with it mounted at /var/lib/docker. Then I made a new XFS filesystem on the with this command:</description>

      <title>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provider for Spinnaker</title>

      <description>Over the last year or so, we have had a group of developers working on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provider for Spinnaker. All of this code has gone directly into the Spinnaker repositories on GitHub and it is all open source.
We are now at the point where the provider is pretty much fully functional and we have published documentation on the spinnaker.io site, and Spinnaker have updated their site to list Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as one of the supported providers, so that is a nice milestone for us!</description>

      <title>Running OpenShift on OCI</title>

      <description>In this post, I want to share my experiences with running OpenShift on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). This is not strictly a &amp;ldquo;how to&amp;rdquo; because I did set this up as a test/development system, not a production one, so I did take a few small short cuts, but I hope that it is still helpful to share.
I am going to set up OpenShift Enterprise 3.11 on a single compute instance on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), so I am using the &amp;ldquo;all in one&amp;rdquo; configuration.</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome to my new blog!
I am an architect at Oracle, and I work in the WebLogic team. I work with technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Istio, OpenShift, ELK, Prometheus, Grafana, as well as developer focused technology areas like CI/CD. So that&amp;rsquo;s the kind of thing I will be writing about here!
I hope you come back soon to read my first real post!
p.s. I am just getting started setting up the blog, I am using Hugo for this blog, unlike my old blog which used WordPress, so I am learning how to drive Hugo!</description>
