      <description>In this post, I want to share my experiences with running OpenShift on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). This is not strictly a &amp;ldquo;how to&amp;rdquo; because I did set this up as a test/development system, not a production one, so I did take a few small short cuts, but I hope that it is still helpful to share.
I am going to set up OpenShift Enterprise 3.11 on a single compute instance on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), so I am using the &amp;ldquo;all in one&amp;rdquo; configuration.</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome to my new blog!
I am an architect at Oracle, and I work in the WebLogic team. I work with technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Istio, OpenShift, ELK, Prometheus, Grafana, as well as developer focused technology areas like CI/CD. So that&amp;rsquo;s the kind of thing I will be writing about here!
I hope you come back soon to read my first real post!
p.s. I am just getting started setting up the blog, I am using Hugo for this blog, unlike my old blog which used WordPress, so I am learning how to drive Hugo!</description>
