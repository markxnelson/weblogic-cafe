      <description>Over the last year or so, we have had a group of developers working on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provider for Spinnaker. All of this code has gone directly into the Spinnaker repositories on GitHub and it is all open source.
We are now at the point where the provider is pretty much fully functional and we have published documentation on the spinnaker.io site, and Spinnaker have updated their site to list Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as one of the supported providers, so that is a nice milestone for us!</description>

      <title>Running OpenShift on OCI</title>

      <description>In this post, I want to share my experiences with running OpenShift on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). This is not strictly a &amp;ldquo;how to&amp;rdquo; because I did set this up as a test/development system, not a production one, so I did take a few small short cuts, but I hope that it is still helpful to share.
I am going to set up OpenShift Enterprise 3.11 on a single compute instance on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), so I am using the &amp;ldquo;all in one&amp;rdquo; configuration.</description>
